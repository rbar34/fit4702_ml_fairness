# LOADING DATA
# import the aequitas group metrics from a) the naive random, b) the directed approach
# calculate the individual test metrics from a) the naive random, b) the directed approach

# CALCULATING
# group metrics: calculate the max-min metrics from each file in a) the naive random, b) the directed approach

# RQ1
# perform repeated measure t-tests grouped by each metric, comparing the means of a) the naive random, b) the directed approach

# RQ2
# perform spearman rho of each metric against each other metric
